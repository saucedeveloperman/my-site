    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>hey there! i am sauce, and i made this site for fun. this is a small challenge to see how good i am at HTML. now here is something about me. I play Geometry dash and osu!taiko. also i make animations whenever i get bored. thats about it. i go by he/him and im a guy :p</p>
    <br>
    <p>on a daily basis i make some music and create scripts. i really enjoy listening to "breakcore" music. it is very fast, but very good. as for coding i am an extreme noobie. i cannot even make a basic shell script! but thats ok.</p>
